# Model-Driven Power Apps: Complete Course
These materials accompany my free complete course on YouTube on how to build Model-Driven Power Apps, which you will find here: https://bit.ly/mdatutorial

I have also written a 150 page complete step-by-step guide, with instructions and screenshots covering the full course, as well as bonus material on how to create a calendar control, how to automate processes from the model-driven app using Power Automate, and how to export and import a solution to move it to a different environment.

In the files here available for free download you will find:

- Images you can use for your Custom Page
- Power Apps themed color palette to use with the custom page shown in the course
