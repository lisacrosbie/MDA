# Model-Driven Power Apps: Complete Course
These materials accompany my free complete course on YouTube on how to build Model-Driven Power Apps, which you will find here: https://youtu.be/HrILchHvMUA
I have also produced a 150 page step by step guide, with instructions and screenshots covering the full course, as well as bonus material on how to create a calendar control, how to automate processes using Power Automate with this model-driven app, and how to export and import a solution to move it to a different environment. The guide is available from my Buy Me a Coffee page here: 

In the files here available for free download you will find:
- The 3 spreadsheets containing sample data to import to the Roles, Contacts, and Applications tables
- Images you can use for your Custom Page
- Power Apps themed color pallette to use with the image I use in the course
